I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) and advised by Dr. [Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/). I am active collaborator at Microsoft India, working with [Manish Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/manishg/) and [Anoop Kunchukuttan](https://anoopkunchukuttan.gitlab.io/). I spent last three wonderful summers interning at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus.aspx) (Translation and Auto-suggest teams) and [Nvidia-AI](https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-gps-ai-capacity-building/nvaitc-research).

<h3><a>Research Interest</a></h3>

My research interest is applied Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on *Multilingual* Natural Language Processing. Simultaneously, I am also working towards improving knowledge augmentation and trustworthy generation with large language models. 

As a multilingual myself, I perceive a pressing need for the development of cross-lingual/multilingual models that can facilitate a range of end-user applications in low-resource languages. In this regard, my research trajectory is primarily geared towards the development of novel models that can enable technology for low-resource languages that has limited or no data. To achieve this overarching objective, I am actively engaged in enhancing multilingual transfer learning models for language generation with limited supervision. My approach to addressing these issues is largely rooted in the linguistic perspective. In particular, my Ph.D. research focuses on anchoring three narrative properties, namely (1) language structure, (2) context, and (3) transferability from/to diverse typological languages. Furthermore, as the use of large language models has increased in recent years, it is crucial to ensure that these models are deployed safely and ethically for the audience. I believe that the aforementioned endeavors constitute a pivotal stride in the direction of accomplishing my research objective, which is to democratize and ensure sefe deployment of NLP technologies.

<!-- My research intreast is applied Machine Learning techniques for Natural Language Processing specifically Multilingual  natural language processing.  As a multilingual myself, I envision a need for a cross-lingual/multilingual model that enables many end-user applications in low-resource languages (LRLs). Towards this trajectory, I am particularly interested in devloping novel models to enable technologies for low-resource languages with limited or no datset. With this overarching objective, I work towards improving multilingual transfer learning models for language generation with limited supervision. I have been mostly approaching issues from the linguistic side.  Specifically, my Ph.D. is focused on anchoring three narrative properties, which are (1) language structure, (2) context, and (3) transferability from/to diverse typological languages. I believe this is a step towards realizing my research mission to democrtize NLP technologies to diverse audiences. -->

Prior to commencing my PhD studies, I served as a *Data Scientist* at [NTWIST](https://ntwist.com/), an AI-startup. Before this, I completed Master's degree (M.Tech) in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Hyderabad](https://www.uohyd.ac.in/)  under the supervision of Prof. [K. Narayana Murthy](http://languagetechnologies.uohyd.ac.in/). I obtained Bachelor's degree (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University. During my PhD, I am humbled to recieve Suzuki foundation fellowship (two years consecutively) to visit Shizuoka University, Japan, for a short research stay.

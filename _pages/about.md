I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) and advised by Dr. [Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/). I am an active collaborator at Microsoft India, working with [Manish Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/manishg/) and [Anoop Kunchukuttan](https://anoopkunchukuttan.gitlab.io/). I spent the last three wonderful summers interning at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/hyderabad-campus.aspx) (Translation and Auto-suggest teams) and [Nvidia-AI](https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-gps-ai-capacity-building/nvaitc-research).

<h3><a>Research Interest</a></h3>

<p class="justified">My research interest is applied Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on <i>Multilingual</i> Natural Language Processing. Simultaneously, I am also working towards improving knowledge augmentation and trustworthy generation with large language models. </p>

<p class="justified">As a multilingual myself, I perceive a pressing need for the development of cross-lingual/multilingual models that can facilitate a range of end-user applications in low-resource languages. In this regard, my research trajectory is primarily geared toward the development of novel models that can enable technology for low-resource languages that have limited or no data. To achieve this overarching objective, I am actively engaged in enhancing multilingual transfer learning models for language generation with limited supervision. My approach to addressing these issues is largely rooted in the linguistic perspective. In particular, my Ph.D. research focuses on anchoring three narrative properties, namely (1) language structure, (2) context, and (3) transferability from/to diverse typological languages. Furthermore, as the use of large language models has increased in recent years, it is crucial to ensure that these models are deployed safely and ethically for the audience. I believe that the aforementioned endeavors constitute a pivotal stride in the direction of accomplishing my research objective, which is to democratize and ensure the safe deployment of NLP technologies.</p>

Prior to commencing my Ph.D. studies, I served as a *Data Scientist* at [NTWIST](https://ntwist.com/), an AI startup. Before this, I completed a Master's degree (M.Tech) in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Hyderabad](https://www.uohyd.ac.in/)  under the supervision of Prof. [K. Narayana Murthy](http://languagetechnologies.uohyd.ac.in/). I obtained a Bachelor's degree (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University. During my Ph.D., I am humbled to receive a Suzuki Foundation Fellowship (two years consecutively) to visit [Shizuoka University, Japan](https://www.shizuoka.ac.jp/) for a short research stay.
